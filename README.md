# automating-with-node.js

Learning how to automate repetitive tasks with Node.js to make development less of a pain

> "I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it."

There are 2 ways to implement the code here:

1. As a list of global commands like alias on a terminal 

2. Make a build tool that deploys project while doing boring tasks for me


## End Goal:

You should be able to make global commands and a node build tool to automate repetitive tasks that you hate to do both we the goal to make life easier

The repo will follow AirBnB coding standards via ESLint with some rules be replaced.
